### Setup
  This application is built from create-react-app
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* Pull down the api: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/ice_fire_api

Both repositories should be cloned down to your machine, and should sit next to
each other. You'll need to create a repo on github to push your frontend
repository to, and then you'll need to change the remote of the frontend app to
match the repo on github.
